LEGAL TEXT CLASSIFICATION - TESTING GUIDE
========================================

📌 WHAT THIS PROJECT DOES:
- Reads legal documents (text or PDF)
- Uses BERT AI to understand the text
- Classifies it into categories from Kaggle dataset
- Shows you the result with confidence score

========================================
🚀 HOW TO RUN:
========================================

1. Open PowerShell in this folder
2. Run: python app.py
3. Wait for it to load (you'll see a public URL)
4. Copy the URL and open it in your browser

========================================
🧪 HOW TO TEST:
========================================

METHOD 1: Get Sample Texts
---------------------------
1. Go to: YOUR_URL/samples
2. You'll see 4 sample legal texts
3. Copy any sample text
4. Use it in the main page

METHOD 2: Type Your Own Text
---------------------------
1. Go to the main page
2. Type or paste legal text in the text box
3. Click "Classify"
4. See the result!

METHOD 3: Upload a File
---------------------------
1. Upload a PDF or text file
2. System will extract text automatically
3. Shows you the classification

========================================
📝 SAMPLE INPUTS TO TRY:
========================================

Sample 1 - Citation:
"In the case of Smith v. Jones (2020), the court cited the precedent set in Brown v. Board of Education regarding constitutional rights."

Sample 2 - Application:
"The court applied the doctrine of res judicata, determining that the matter had already been adjudicated in a prior proceeding."

Sample 3 - Following Precedent:
"Following the established precedent in Miranda v. Arizona, the court ruled that the defendant's rights were violated."

Sample 4 - Reference:
"The judgment referred to multiple international conventions including the Geneva Convention."

========================================
📊 UNDERSTANDING RESULTS:
========================================

When you submit text, you'll get:
✅ Label: The category (like "cited", "applied", etc.)
✅ Confidence: How sure the AI is (like 95.67%)
✅ All Categories: List of possible categories from dataset

Example Result:
{
  "label": "cited",
  "confidence": "95.67%",
  "all_categories": ["cited", "applied", "followed", "referred to"]
}

========================================
❓ TROUBLESHOOTING:
========================================

Problem: "Could not load CSV"
Solution: Make sure legal_text_classification.csv is in the same folder

Problem: "No text provided"
Solution: Make sure you typed something in the text box

Problem: Model loading takes time
Solution: First time always takes longer. Be patient!

Problem: Low confidence score
Solution: Try more specific legal text with clear keywords

========================================
📂 PROJECT FILES:
========================================

app.py - Main Python code (brain of the system)
legal_text_classification.csv - Kaggle dataset with legal categories
templates/index.html - Web interface (front page)
uploads/ - Temporary folder for uploaded files

========================================
🎯 PROJECT EXPLANATION (SIMPLE):
========================================

1. DATA SOURCE: Uses Kaggle legal classification dataset
2. AI MODEL: BERT (understands text like a human)
3. PROCESS: 
   - Read CSV → Get categories
   - Load BERT model → AI brain ready
   - User sends text → BERT analyzes
   - BERT picks category → Show result
4. OUTPUT: Category name + confidence score

========================================
👥 FOR PROJECT PRESENTATION:
========================================

What to Say:
"Our system uses a Kaggle legal dataset with BERT AI to automatically classify legal documents. Just input any legal text, and it tells you what type it is - like if it's a citation, application, or reference. The BERT model achieves high accuracy by understanding the context and meaning of legal language."

Key Points:
✓ Uses real Kaggle dataset (not hardcoded)
✓ BERT AI for accurate classification
✓ Works with text input or PDF upload
✓ Shows confidence score
✓ Easy web interface
